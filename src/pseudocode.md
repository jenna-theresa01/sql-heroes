# Project Requirements:

1. Create a Connection to a Database using Python 3 and view the database (using the vscode extension)

2. The supplied superheroes.sql database file (attached to global classroom assignment) contains CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements to get you started with seeded data. (Do not modify the SQL file) Use the VSCode extension to execute the file from the top to bottom to get the appropriate tables/entries created.

3. Decide/Plan/Pseudocode on a minimum of four CRUD operations you wish to implement (at least on operation for Create, Read, Update, & delete) - document these in your README.md

4. Interactive creation, update, delete of a hero in the terminal via Python script, with commands that are available for the README.md

- This is completely backend project. There will be no visual elements to it in a browser but will be interactive in the terminal

## Stretch Goals

Write and add to your script actions for your superheroes so they...

- Can have mutual friends
- Can add new friends
- Can have mutual enemies
- Can add new enemies
- Can add likes 
- Can add dislikes
- Can have multiple hero abilities
- More interactivity in the terminal (i.e. a search of heroes, get list of heroes friends, add abilities, etc.)
- ASCII art for visual elements 

#### What do I need to do: 

- connect the database
-
